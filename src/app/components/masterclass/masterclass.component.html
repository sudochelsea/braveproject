                        <h2>Changing the Narrative Masterclass</h2>
                        <p>First-hand opportunity to gain career insights, develop new skills, grow your confidence and find the right career
                             path.
                        </p>
                        <p>Project BRAVEâ€™s MasterClass series is a monthly event that will enable us to bridge the gap between the 
                            unlimited potential among our female youth, and the limited career opportunities that exist today in 
                            the world of work. The future of far too many young women are determined by their background,
                             but not their potential.</p>
                    <p>The #ChangingTheNarrative MasterClass seeks to create a network of high profile educators and employers, 
                        who are willing to bestow their knowledge and experiences on the next generation of young female leaders.
                         We welcome all professionals across every industry sector, who believe that every young woman,
                          regardless of background, deserves the opportunity to kick-start a rewarding future.</p>
